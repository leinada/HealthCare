#### Cancer classification basd on micro array Gene Expression
----------------------------------------------------------------

- Apply deep learning techniques to perform cancer Classification ased on Microarray Gene Expression Data. Notebook [here](https://github.com/leinada/HealthCare/blob/master/cancerClassification_geneMicroArray/cancerClassification_microArrayGeneExpressionData_KERAS.ipynb)
- This project requires Python 3.x, NumPy,Pandas, matplotlib,sklearn, KERAS libraries
- Analysis includes
  * preprocessing of the data,  scaling of features and encoding, training and validation of model training using KERAS

#### Breast Cancer Prediction
---------------------------------------------------------------
- Prediction of benign and malignant breast cancer using data mining techniques. This analysis aims to observe which features are most helpful in predicting malignant or benign breast cancer (data from UCI machine learning repository)
- Analysis includes
  * preprocessing of the data,  training and validation of model using different ML algos such as KNN, Random Forest, SVC, Decision tree, ...

#### Diabetes Prediction
----------------------------------------------------------------
- Goal is to predict the onset of diabetes in Pima Indians within five years using different ML techniques.
- Analysis include. Note book [here](https://github.com/leinada/HealthCare/blob/master/diabetes_prediction/diabetes.ipynb) 
   * preprocessing, classification report, ROC curve
